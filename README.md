# Desktop AI Assistant

This is an AI-based desktop assistant, similar to Siri and Alexa, designed to assist users with voice and text commands. It can process tasks such as answering questions, performing searches, and managing simple tasks. The assistant utilizes natural language processing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech capabilities, offering a seamless user experience with both text-based and voice-based input.

## Features

- **Voice and Text Commands**: Users can interact with the assistant using their voice or by typing commands.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The assistant is powered by the ChatGPT API, which allows it to understand and generate natural language responses.
- **Speech Recognition**: With the `speech_recognition` library, the assistant can listen to voice commands and process them efficiently.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Using `pyttsx3`, the assistant can speak back to the user, providing a fully interactive experience.
- **Web-Based UI**: The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to provide a clean and responsive interface.
- **Desktop Application**: Utilizing `Eel`, the project bridges the web-based interface with Python for desktop functionality.
- **Database Integration**: SQL is used for storing and retrieving data, enhancing the assistantâ€™s ability to manage information effectively.
